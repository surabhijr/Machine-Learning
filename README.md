# Drug Classification using Machine-Learning Techniques
The evolution of drug discovery and design technologies has been worldwide. The reactions of Adverse drugs might increase the amount of mortality. Hence It is necessary to identify the effect of drugs on unique targets. The research paper explores machine learning algorithms which are applied to the dataset of patients who suffered from the same illness, where during the course of treatment each patient responded to a different set of drugs. The aim of this project is to develop a model which classifies the drugs that are appropriate for a future patient with the same illness based on feature extraction with good computational efficiency.

# Data 
The dataset used as a part of this paper consists of data of multiple people across various age groups suffering from a similar kind of disease. This dataset has been obtianed from Kaggle below mentioned is the link Link to https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prathamtripathi/drugclassification?datasetId=8309

# Methods
1. Decision Trees
2. K Nearest Neighbor
3. Logistic Regression
